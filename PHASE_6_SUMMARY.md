# Phase 6 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 6: Newsletter Draft Generation has been **fully implemented**. This phase enables the core functionality of CreatorPulse - automatically generating newsletter drafts from trending content using AI.

## What Was Built

### 1. Backend Components

#### Draft Models (`backend/app/models/draft.py`)
- **DraftStatus**: Enum for draft states (generating, ready, editing, published, failed)
- **DraftSection**: Individual sections within a draft (intro, topic, conclusion)
- **DraftBase, DraftCreate, DraftUpdate, DraftResponse**: Core draft models
- **GenerateDraftRequest, RegenerateDraftRequest, PublishDraftRequest**: API request models
- **DraftListResponse, DraftGenerationResult**: API response models

#### Draft Generation Service (`backend/app/services/draft_generator.py`)
- **DraftGenerator class**: Main service for generating newsletter drafts
- **Key Features**:
  - Generates drafts from trending topics using Groq LLM
  - Integrates with trend detector and content summarizer
  - Applies user's voice profile for personalized writing style
  - Creates structured newsletters with intro, topic sections, and conclusion
  - Fallback mechanisms when trends or LLM generation fails
  - Stores drafts in database with metadata

#### Email Service (`backend/app/services/email_service.py`)
- **EmailService class**: Handles newsletter email delivery
- **Key Features**:
  - Sends newsletters via Gmail SMTP
  - Converts drafts to HTML and plain text formats
  - Sends draft notification emails to users
  - Tracks email delivery status
  - Professional email templates with proper formatting

#### Draft Scheduler (`backend/app/services/draft_scheduler.py`)
- **DraftScheduler class**: Manages scheduled draft generation
- **Key Features**:
  - Daily draft generation at 8:00 AM (configurable)
  - Generates drafts for all active users with sources
  - Respects user preferences (topic count, voice profile usage)
  - Sends email notifications when drafts are ready
  - Logs generation statistics for monitoring

#### Draft API Routes (`backend/app/api/routes/drafts.py`)
- **POST /api/drafts/generate**: Generate new draft
- **GET /api/drafts**: List all user drafts
- **GET /api/drafts/{id}**: Get specific draft
- **PUT /api/drafts/{id}**: Update draft (edit title, sections, metadata)
- **POST /api/drafts/{id}/regenerate**: Regenerate draft with fresh content
- **POST /api/drafts/{id}/publish**: Publish and send draft via email
- **DELETE /api/drafts/{id}**: Delete draft

### 2. Frontend Components

#### Drafts List Page (`frontend/src/pages/Drafts.tsx`)
- **Features**:
  - Lists all user drafts with status badges
  - Shows draft metadata (topic count, read time, sent status)
  - "Generate New Draft" button with loading state
  - Click to navigate to draft review page
  - Empty state with helpful messaging
  - Error handling and user feedback

#### Draft Review Page (`frontend/src/pages/DraftReview.tsx`)
- **Features**:
  - Full draft preview with formatted sections
  - Inline editing mode for title and content
  - Save changes functionality
  - Publish & Send button (sends via email)
  - Regenerate draft option
  - Delete draft option
  - Status indicators (ready, editing, published)
  - Shows trends used in draft generation
  - Responsive design with proper spacing

#### UI Components
- **Textarea component** (`frontend/src/components/ui/Textarea.tsx`): Created for multi-line text editing

### 3. Integration Points

#### Scheduler Integration
- Updated `backend/app/services/scheduler.py` to initialize draft scheduler
- Draft generation runs daily alongside content crawling

#### Main App Integration
- Added draft routes to `backend/app/main.py`
- Added draft pages to `frontend/src/App.tsx` with protected routes

## Database Schema Requirements

The following tables are needed (should be created via Supabase):

### `newsletter_drafts`
```sql
CREATE TABLE newsletter_drafts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  sections JSONB NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ready',
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  generated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  published_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  email_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  email_sent_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_newsletter_drafts_user_id ON newsletter_drafts(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_newsletter_drafts_status ON newsletter_drafts(status);
```

### `user_preferences` (if not exists)
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE UNIQUE,
  preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### `draft_generation_logs` (optional, for monitoring)
```sql
CREATE TABLE draft_generation_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  generated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  success_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  error_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  total_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in `.env`:

```env
# Gmail SMTP (already configured in Phase 1)
GMAIL_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587

# Groq API (already configured)
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key

# Frontend URL (for email links)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

## Testing Checklist

### Backend API Tests
- [ ] Generate draft for user with trends
- [ ] Generate draft for user without trends (fallback)
- [ ] List drafts for user
- [ ] Get specific draft
- [ ] Update draft (edit content)
- [ ] Regenerate draft
- [ ] Publish draft (send email)
- [ ] Delete draft
- [ ] Scheduled generation (manual trigger)

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Navigate to /drafts page
- [ ] Generate new draft button
- [ ] View draft list
- [ ] Click to open draft review
- [ ] Edit draft title and sections
- [ ] Save changes
- [ ] Publish draft
- [ ] Regenerate draft
- [ ] Delete draft

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end: Generate → Edit → Publish → Email received
- [ ] Scheduled task runs at configured time
- [ ] Email notifications sent correctly
- [ ] Voice profile applied to draft
- [ ] Trends correctly included in draft

## Usage Flow

1. **User connects sources** (Twitter, YouTube, RSS)
2. **System crawls content daily** (existing Phase 5 functionality)
3. **System detects trends** (existing Phase 5 functionality)
4. **System generates draft at 8:00 AM**:
   - Fetches top trending topics
   - Gets content summaries
   - Applies user's voice profile
   - Creates structured newsletter
   - Sends email notification
5. **User receives email** with link to review draft
6. **User reviews draft** at `/drafts/{id}`
7. **User can**:
   - Edit content inline
   - Save changes
   - Regenerate with fresh content
   - Publish and send to subscribers
   - Delete draft

## Next Steps (Phase 7)

The next phase will implement the **Feedback Loop**:
- Thumbs up/down on draft sections
- Feedback collection and storage
- Style refinement based on feedback
- Improved draft quality over time

## Notes

- **Timezone Handling**: Currently uses server time for scheduled generation. For production, implement per-user timezone preferences.
- **Email Limits**: Gmail has sending limits (500/day for regular accounts). Monitor usage and consider upgrading to Google Workspace for higher limits.
- **LLM Costs**: Monitor Groq API usage and costs as draft generation scales.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling implemented with fallbacks for LLM failures.
- **Performance**: Draft generation is async and runs in background tasks to avoid blocking.
