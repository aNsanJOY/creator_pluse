- **Swagger UI:** http://localhost:8000/docs
- **ReDoc:** http://localhost:8000/redoc

## Quick Test

### 1. Get Authentication Token
First, login or signup to get an authentication token:

```bash
# Signup
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/auth/signup" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "testpassword123",
    "full_name": "Test User"
  }'

# Login
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "testpassword123"
  }'
```

Save the `access_token` from the response.

### 2. Upload a Newsletter Sample

**Option A: Upload text directly**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/newsletters/upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \

  -d '{
    "title": "My First Newsletter",
    "content": "Welcome to my newsletter! This week I want to share some exciting updates about AI and technology. The field is moving incredibly fast, and there are so many interesting developments to discuss."
  }'
```
